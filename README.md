# PyTorch ChatBot

This is a simple AI chatbot project built with PyTorch and NLTK, capable of understanding basic user queries using predefined intents and responding accordingly.

---

## Features

- Conversational interface via command line
- Machine learning-based intent recognition
- Customizable training data through `intents.json`
- Fast training on small datasets
- Lightweight and runs entirely offline

---

## File Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ chat.py           # CLI chatbot interface
â”œâ”€â”€ train.py          # Trains the chatbot model
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py          # Defines the neural network model
â”œâ”€â”€ nltk_utils.py     # Preprocessing: tokenize, stem, bag-of-words
â”œâ”€â”€ intents.json      # Contains the training data (questions + responses)
â””â”€â”€ data.pth          # Trained model weights (generated after training)
```

---

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone or download this project.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd A:\pytorch-chatbot-master
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch numpy nltk
```

4. Download the NLTK tokenizer:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## Training the Bot

If you're running the bot for the first time or have made changes to `intents.json`, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Preprocess the training data
- Train the neural network
- Save a model file as `data.pth`

Expected output includes:

```
training complete. file saved to data.pth
```

---

## Running the ChatBot

To start a chat session, run:

```bash
python chat.py
```

Youâ€™ll see:

```
Let's chat! (type 'quit' to exit)
You:
```

Now you can start chatting with the bot.

## Recommended Questions

To get the best results, ask questions that the chatbot has been trained to recognize.

### Greetings
- Hi
- Hello
- How are you?
- Is anyone there?

### Saying Goodbye
- Bye
- See you later
- Goodbye

### Thank You
- Thanks
- Thank you
- Thatâ€™s helpful

### Product Inquiry
- What items do you have?
- What do you sell?
- Which items are available?

### Payment
- Do you take credit cards?
- Do you accept Mastercard?
- Can I pay with PayPal?

### Delivery
- How long does delivery take?
- When will I get my delivery?

### Humor
- Tell me a joke!
- Do you know a joke?

## Limitations

- No conversation memory; each message is treated independently
- Not suitable for real-time factual queries or general knowledge questions
- No spelling correction or synonym recognition
- Only responds to inputs defined in the `intents.json` file
- Ignores queries if prediction confidence is below the defined threshold (75%)

---

## Ways to Improve

- Add more intents and variations in `intents.json`
- Implement spell checking and synonym matching
- Add support for contextual memory between messages
- Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Upgrade to transformer models like BERT or GPT for improved intent recognition

---

## Example of `intents.json` Format

```json
{
  "tag": "greeting",
  "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "Hello", "Good day"],
  "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there, how can I help?", "Hey there"]
}
```
