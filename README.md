### 📄 `README.md`

```markdown
# 🤖 PyTorch ChatBot

This is a simple AI chatbot project built with **PyTorch** and **NLTK**, capable of understanding basic user queries using predefined intents and responding accordingly.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 Conversational interface (command-line)
- 🧠 Machine learning-based intent recognition
- 🗃️ Customizable intent-data (`intents.json`)
- ⚡ Fast training on small datasets
- 📦 Lightweight and runs fully offline

---

## 📁 File Structure

```bash
.
├── chat.py           # CLI chatbot interface
├── train.py          # Trains the chatbot model
├── model.py          # Defines the neural network model
├── nltk_utils.py     # Preprocessing: tokenize, stem, bag-of-words
├── intents.json      # Contains the training data (questions + responses)
└── data.pth          # Trained model weights (generated after training)
```

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone or download this project.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd A:\pytorch-chatbot-master
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch numpy nltk
```

4. Download the NLTK tokenizer:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## 🧠 Training the Bot

If you're running the bot for the first time or you’ve made changes to `intents.json`, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Preprocess the training data
- Train the neural network
- Save a model file as `data.pth`

You should see output like:

```
training complete. file saved to data.pth
```

---

## 💬 Chat With the Bot

To start a chat session, run:

```bash
python chat.py
```

You’ll see:

```
Let's chat! (type 'quit' to exit)
You:
```

Now you can start chatting!

---

## ❓ What Should I Ask?

To get the best experience, ask questions that the chatbot has been trained to recognize.

### 👋 Greetings
- `Hi`
- `Hello`
- `How are you?`
- `Is anyone there?`

### 🙋 Saying Goodbye
- `Bye`
- `See you later`
- `Goodbye`

### 🙏 Thank You
- `Thanks`
- `Thank you`
- `That’s helpful`

### 🛒 Product Inquiry
- `What items do you have?`
- `What do you sell?`
- `Which items are available?`

### 💳 Payment
- `Do you take credit cards?`
- `Do you accept Mastercard?`
- `Can I pay with PayPal?`

### 🚚 Delivery
- `How long does delivery take?`
- `When will I get my delivery?`

### 😂 Humor
- `Tell me a joke!`
- `Do you know a joke?`

## ❌ Limitations

- ❗ **No memory** — doesn’t remember previous inputs
- 📚 **Not factual** — can’t answer real-world questions like “What’s the capital of Japan?”
- ✍️ **No spell correction** — spelling mistakes may break intent detection
- 🔤 **Limited vocabulary** — only understands what’s in `intents.json`
- 📉 **Confidence threshold** — skips responses if prediction confidence < 75%

---

## 🔧 How to Improve It

- Add more intents and patterns to `intents.json`
- Introduce spelling correction or synonyms
- Implement contextual memory or conversation history
- Create a web interface with Flask or Streamlit
- Upgrade to transformer models (BERT, GPT) for smarter intent detection

---

## 📌 Example of `intents.json` Entry

```json
{
  "tag": "greeting",
  "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "Hello", "Good day"],
  "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there, how can I help?", "Hey :-)"]
}
```
